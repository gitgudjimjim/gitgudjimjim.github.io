          Wartime veterans who have limited or no income may be eligible for the non-service-connected disability veterans pension, a tax-free monthly benefit paid by the federal VA. The financially struggling spouses and children of deceased wartime veterans may also be eligible for pension benefits.

It is highly recommended that you seek the free assistance of an ODVA-trained and certified veteran service officer, who can help you determine the benefits you may qualify for and walk you through the application process.

      <h3 class="text-center">Veterans Pension</h3>
        <p>
          ​This benefit provides supplemental income to help veterans and their families cope with challenges arising from homelessness and other financial crises. The amount paid is set by federal law and varies based on your net worth and the amount you and your dependents receive from other sources.

      <h3 class="text-center">Survivors' Pension</h3>
        <p>
          ​If you are the financially struggling spouse or child of a deceased veteran who served his or her country during wartime, you may be eligible for survivors pension, a benefit of the federal VA.

Also known as death pension, survivors pension is a tax-free, needs-based monetary benefit for the survivors of deceased veterans, if your income is low enough to meet the requirements set by Congress. You must also be single (children must be unmarried to be eligible; spouses must not have remarried).

      <h3 class="text-center">Aid and Attendance</h3>
        <p>
          Veterans and survivors who qualify for a federal VA pension due to financial circumstances may be eligible for additional compensation if you require the aid and attendance of another person. This tax-free supplement to the monthly pension is commonly called A&A.

You or your deceased spouse must meet the federal VA’s service, age, disability and income requirements for Veterans Pension or Survivors Pension to be eligible for A&A.

Since the A&A provision increases the income allowance, you may be eligible for a supplemented pension even if your income is too high for a basic pension. However, you must still meet the applicable service and age or disability requirements.

      <h3 class="text-center">Housebound</h3>
        <p>
          Veterans and survivors who qualify for a federal VA pension due to financial circumstances may be eligible for additional compensation if you are housebound, meaning confined to your home because of permanent disability.

You or your deceased spouse must meet the federal VA’s service, age, disability and income requirements for veterans pension or survivors pension to be eligible for this additional tax-free monthly compensation.

Since the housebound provision increases the income allowance, you may be eligible for a supplemented pension even if your income is too high for a basic pension. However, you must still meet the applicable service and age or disability requirements.

Those who qualify for a pension may also be eligible for additional compensation due to needing the aid and attendance (A&A) of another person, which is based on different criteria. However, you cannot receive both A&A and Housebound benefits at the same time.

How to apply

The federal VA requires you to submit evidence in support of your request for an increased monthly pension, preferably a report from your attending physician validating the need for housebound care.
