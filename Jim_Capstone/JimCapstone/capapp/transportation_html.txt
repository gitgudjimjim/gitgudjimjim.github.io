You are here:The federal VA offers transportation benefits and adaptive programs to help with the unique needs of rural and disabled veterans.This federal VA program provides eligible beneficiaries
reimbursement for mileage and/or costs incurred while traveling to and from VA
health care facilities, to include special modes of transportation, and in
certain circumstances, common carrier transportation, such as bus, taxi,
airline or train travel.For more information: Federal VA: Transportation Program​In addition to federal VA-provided transportation services, Disabled American Veterans (DAV) operates a nationwide network of volunteer
drivers to transport veterans to and from VA medical facilities for
treatment. This network includes 189
Hospital Service Coordinators around the country to assist in coordinating
transportation. Because the DAV
Transportation Network is staffed by volunteers, service may not be available
in your area.For more information: DAV: Need a Ride?DAV Transportation Volunteers NeededMany DAV volunteers are former service members, making the
Transportation Network a clear example of veterans helping veterans, and the
organization is always looking for more volunteer drivers.  To volunteer: DAV: Drive a Van​Starting in January 2019, eligible veterans are able to obtain an Oregon Wounded Warrior parking placard. The new placard is the result of Senate Bill 1506 and exempts the driver from paying fees in public parking areas with metered parking. It also enables veterans to park in time-limited spaces for longer than the posted limit (except in zones that are designated 30 minutes or less). There is no fee for the placard, and it will carry the same expiration as the veteran’s driver license. Who qualifies?Oregon veterans who qualify for a disabled parking permit from the Oregon Department of Transportation’s Driver & Motor Vehicles Division (DMV) and have a service-connected disability that is VA-rated at 50% or greater.For more information: Oregon Driver & Motor Vehicle Services: Disabled Person ​Parking Permits​ ​Distance and transportation to and from medical appointments are
routinely cited by rural veterans as the main obstacles to obtaining health
care.  One answer to this is the VA’s
Highly Rural Transportation Program, which provides free transportation to and
from medical appointments (not just those at VA facilities) to any veteran
living in one of Oregon’s participating highly rural counties.  Services include door-to-door pick-up and
drop-off in ADA-compliant vehicles, with assistance in loading or unloading at
no cost to the veteran.This service is made possible by an annual federal VA Highly Rural
Transportation Grant administered through the Oregon Department of Veterans’
Affairs (ODVA) in conjunction with local partners throughout the state.  2017 marked the fourth consecutive year that
the ODVA received the grant, which awards a maximum of $50,000 for each
participating county. The program runs on a year-to-year basis, and
transportation services are subject to grant fund availability each fiscal
year.Who qualifies?Oregon has 10 counties that are considered "highly
rural" by the U.S. Census Bureau: Baker, Gilliam, Grant, Lake, Harney, Malheur,
Morrow, Sherman, Wallowa and Wheeler. If you are a veteran living in one of
these counties and would like more information about the Highly Rural
Transportation program, please contact your local county or transportation
office.For more information: A complete list of the appropriate contacts can be found here​.The Veterans Healthcare Administration has a transportation
program for non-ambulatory and remote VA patients.  The Veterans Transportation Service (VTS)
provides transport for veterans to VA Medical Centers (VAMCs). These services
include vehicle routing and scheduling software for VA medical facilities.While all veterans with federal VA-funded medical appointments are
eligible to ride VTS, a first priority is given to wheelchair-bound patients
who have no other transportation alternatives. 
VTS is establishing a network of community volunteer transportation
service providers to improve access to VA health care, including the Portland
VAMC.Reservations are needed for transportation at least four
full business days before the date transport id needed.  Specific information about the veteran is
also required.To make a reservation, call 503-721-7804 or 800-949-1004,
