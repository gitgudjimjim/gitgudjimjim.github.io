You are here:The federal VA operates a robust and comprehensive health care system for veterans in Oregon, consisting of three full-service Medical Centers and numerous Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs).​If you served in a combat theater of operations after
November 11, 1998, you may be eligible to receive free or reduced-cost health care
for a period of five years immediately following your active duty discharge,
regardless of whether your medical needs are deemed service-connected.  This is thanks to enhanced eligibility
criteria under the federal VA’s “Combat Veteran” authority, which allows
returning combat veterans to enroll in the VA health care system at a
higher-than-basic Priority Group, where you will have full access to the VA’s
medical benefits package.The 5-year enrollment period begins on the date you separated
from active duty, or, if a reservist or national guardsman with multiple
call-ups, on your most recent discharge date. Eligibility for VA health care is
normally contingent upon other factors such as a service-connected disability
or a veteran’s financial circumstances; thus, combat veterans are strongly
encouraged to apply for enrollment within their 5-year enhanced eligibility
period, even if no medical care is currently needed.Veterans, including members of the National Guard
and activated reservists, who served on active duty in a theater of combat
operations after November  11, 1998, and
have been discharged under other than dishonorable conditions.Theaters of combat operations during this time period
include locales related to Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom,
Operation New Dawn, as well as numerous other areas of hostilities and/or
imminent danger. For a complete list see here.Benefits include enrollment in Priority Group 6 or higher, eligibility
for Choice Card Program, federal VA dental benefits, and more.For more information: Federal VA: Health Benefits for Returning Service Members​If you are already enrolled in VA health care, the Choice Program allows you to receive health care within your community. Using this program does NOT impact your existing VA health care, or any other VA benefit.For more information: Federal VA: Veterans Choice Program EligibilityYour first step in attaining federal VA health benefits is
to apply for enrollment in the VA health care system. During the application verification process,
the VA considers a variety of factors to determine your eligibility for
enrollment. Consult the Eligibility​
section of this webpage for more details.To learn more
about the benefits you could receive through VA health care, visit the VA Health Benefits Explorer.How to apply for enrollmentThere are four ways that you can apply for enrollment in the
VA health care system:  by telephone,
online, in person, or by mail.For more information: Federal VA: Ways to Enroll​If you served in the active military service and were discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable, you may qualify for federal VA health care benefits. Reservists and National Guard members may also qualify for VA health care benefits if they were called to active duty (other than for training purposes) by a federal order and completed the full period for which they were called up.For more information: Federal VA: Health Care​My HealtheVet is your online Personal Health Record that allows you to access and manage your federal VA health information conveniently and efficiently, 24 hours a day/7 days a week.

facilities under certain circumstances: if you are too far from a federal VA facility to receive care in a safe, timely
manner, or if your local federal VA facility is not properly equipped to handle your
type of emergency care needs.In such cases, the 2010 Veterans Emergency Care Protective
Act enables the federal VA to reimburse veterans enrolled in federal VA health care for the remaining cost of emergency treatment if the veteran has outside insurance that
only covers part of the cost.If non-federal VA emergency care is received, notification to the
nearest federal VA health care facility must be made within 72 hours of
hospitalization. Federal VA payment is limited up to the point that the veteran’s
condition is stable for transport to a federal VA facility.For more information: Federal VA: Emergency Care​The Patient Advocacy Program is for all veterans and their
families who receive care at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities
and clinics.  The federal VA wants to be
sure that you have someone to go to with your concerns in a timely manner and
to help you receive care.If you need help getting care or getting your problems
resolved, talk to the Patient Advocate at your nearest VA Medical Center. For more information: Federal VA: Patient Advocacy ProgramThe federal VA's prescription benefit
ensures that you receive safe, effective, medically necessary medications that
represent a good value. If you are being
treated by a federal VA primary care provider, you will be provided all
necessary medications for your treatment. 
The cost of medications depends on your disability status:  If you have a service-connected disability,
you may receive federal VA medications free of charge. If you do not have a service-connected
disability, you may be charged a copayment for each 30-day supply of
medications the federal VA provides.For more information: Federal VA: Prescriptions​​For the
purpose of disability compensation, there are specific health conditions, even
if they were not incurred or aggravated during military service, that the
federal VA presumes to be service-connected because of the unique nature of
certain veterans’ military service. These are called presumptive health conditions.Note: The VA will also consider other conditions
not listed, if supported by medical or scientific evidence. To be eligible for
disability compensation, the VA must be able to establish that it is at least as
likely as not that a veteran’s disease was caused by their military service.
Working with a veteran service officer will help you determine if your health
condition meets any of the qualifying presumptive health conditions.For more
information: Federal VA: Presumptive Health Conditions​There are a number of services available to ensure that you
have safe and reliable transportation to and from your federal VA medical
appointments. These include:
