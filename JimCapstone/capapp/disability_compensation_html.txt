In some cases, the surviving parents or dependents of veterans killed or wounded in the line of duty may also be eligible for compensation. These benefits are tax-free.It is highly recommended that you seek the free assistance of an ODVA-trained and certified veteran service officer, who can help you determine the benefits you may qualify for and walk you through the application process. For more information about the process, see How to File a Disability Claim.For eligible disabled veteran drivers, the federal VA Automobile Adaptive Equipment (AAE) program will cover the cost of installation of adaptive equipment deemed necessary to safely operate vehicles, and to satisfy applicable state standards of licensure. This equipment includes power steering, power brakes, power door openers, power window lifts, power seats, hand controls, left foot gas pedals, reduced effort and zero effort steering and braking, and digital driving systems. Also included is additional equipment necessary for assisting the person into and out of the vehicle, such as wheelchair lifts, UVLs (under vehicle lifts), lowered floors/raised roofs, and raised doors.The VA will also repair, replace, or reinstall adaptive equipment deemed necessary for the operation of a vehicle acquired under this program, or a vehicle an eligible veteran may have previously or subsequently acquired.See current automobile allowance rates here.For more information: Federal VA: Automobile Adaptive Equipment (AAE) ProgramIf you require the use of prosthetic or orthopedic appliances, such as a wheelchair or crutches, or a physician-prescribed skin medication as a result of a service-connected disability or injury, you may be eligible for an annual clothing allowance from the federal VA.

These grant programs include the Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant, the Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) grant, and the Home Improvements and Structural Alterations (HISA) grant.Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) GrantUnder the SHA grant program, the VA may approve a grant for the actual cost for adaptations to a veteran’s residence — either
their own home or that of a family member with whom they reside — determined by
the VA to be reasonably necessary to promote ease and freedom of movement
throughout the house. These include, but are not limited to, the installation
of covered porches, entry ramps and walkways, security devices, sliding doors,
handrails, and grab bars.The grant may also be applied to new
home purchases: either toward acquiring a residence that has already been
adapted with special features for the veteran’s disability, or to modifying a
home which the veteran or hosting family member intends to buy.Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) GrantSAH grants provide toward the cost of building, buying, or remodeling adapted homes, or
paying indebtedness on homes previously acquired. Additionally, SAH grants can
be used to purchase land on which specially-adapted housing is to be built.For more information: Federal VA: SHA and SAH GrantsSpecially Adapted Housing Assistive Technology
(SAHAT) Grant ProgramThis federal VA program awards grants
to persons or entities to encourage the
development of specially-adapted assistive technologies that enhance a disabled
veteran’s ability to live independently, such as voice-recognition and
voice-command operations, living environment controls, and adaptive feeding
equipment.For more information: Federal VA: Specially Adapted Housing Assistive Technology (SAHAT) Grant ProgramSupplemental Financing Loan GuarantyVeterans who have available loan
guarantee entitlement may also obtain a guaranteed loan or possibly a direct
loan from the federal VA to supplement the grants to acquire a specially-adapted
home.For more information: Federal VA: Home LoansHome Improvements and Structural Alterations
(HISA)This federal VA program provides
funding for disabled veterans to make home improvements necessary for the
continuation of treatment or for disability access to the home, and essential
lavatory and sanitary facilities.Disabled veterans may be eligible for
HISA when it is determined medically necessary or appropriate for the effective
and economical treatment of the service-connected disability.For more information: Federal VA:  Home Improvements and Structural Alterations(HISA) Did you know that you can access much of your personal
information and perform a variety of self-service tasks online through the federal
VA’s eBenefits Web portal? Military records and information regarding such
issues as healthcare, education, and pension benefits are among those
accessible via a secure, personalized dashboard. There, you can also file and
update claims for disability compensation, as well as access employment
resources.Note: Before
you can access and use eBenefits, you must be listed in the Defense Enrollment
Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) and obtain a DS Logon.For more information: Federal VA: eBenefits Web Portal​Disability compensation is a tax free monetary benefit paid to veterans with disabilities that
are the result of a disease or injury incurred or aggravated during active
military service. For more information: Disability CompensationDisability compensation
is a monthly, tax-free benefit paid to veterans who are at least 10 percent
disabled because of injuries, diseases or conditions that were incurred or
aggravated during active duty or training, or from injury, heart attack or
stroke that occurred during inactive duty training. The
service-connected disability can apply to physical health conditions, such as a
chronic knee injury or Lou Gehrig’s disease, as well as mental health
conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Post-service
disabilities that are considered related or secondary to disabilities occurring
in service may also be eligible for compensation, as well as disabilities
presumed to be related to military service, which are known as presumptive health conditions.EligibilityTo be
eligible, you must have been released from military service under honorable
conditions, meaning an honorable or general discharge. Compensation
varies based on the severity of your disability. Generally, the degrees of
disability are designed to compensate for a considerable loss of working time due
to exacerbations or illnesses.The federal
VA rates disabilities on a 10-point scale from 0 to 100 percent (e.g., 10
percent, 20 percent, 30 percent, etc.). You may be eligible for additional
compensation if your service-connected disability is very severe or you have
lost limbs, or if you have dependents or a seriously disabled spouse. (See "Special Monthly Compensation​")If the VA
finds that you have more than one disability, the rates are combined based on a
calculation explained here. Compensation is set based on federal law and is not subject to state or federal
income tax.For more
information: Federal VA: Disability CompensationThe
surviving dependents of veterans and service members killed or wounded in the
line of duty may be eligible for dependency
and indemnity compensation (DIC), a tax-free monetary benefit paid by the
federal VA. This benefit
is for survivors of service members who died while on active duty or in training,
or survivors of veterans whose death resulted from a service-connected injury
or disease.DIC is the
primary monetary benefit for eligible dependents of deceased veterans and is
essentially the equivalent benefit of disability compensation for veterans. Compensation
rates are set by federal law. In addition to the basic monthly rate,
surviving spouses may be eligible for additional compensation if you have
dependent children, or if you are housebound or in need of aid and attendance.How to applyThe VA
requires you to submit evidence in support of your claim, demonstrating that
your spouse or parent was killed in the line of duty or that his or her death
resulted from a service-connected condition. This evidence may include service records,
medical records and other documentation.For more
information: Federal VA: Dependency and Indemnity Compensation​The
financially struggling parents of veterans and service members killed or
wounded in the line of duty may be eligible for Parents’ Dependency and
Indemnity Compensation, a tax-free monetary benefit paid by the federal VA.This benefit
is similar to the VA’s Dependency and
Indemnity Compensation (DIC), which is for the surviving spouses and
children of deceased veterans whose deaths were service-connected. The main difference
is that, unlike regular DIC, parents’ DIC is also income-based, meaning
applicants must have an income below the level set by Congress to qualify. More information about eligibility and how the income rates are calculated can be found on the federal VA's website​.Eligibility The parent
of any service member who died while on active duty or in training, or of any
veteran whose death resulted from a service-connected injury or disease, may be
eligible for this benefit. Biological,
adoptive and foster parents are all eligible, foster parent being defined as a
person who stood in the relationship of a parent for at least one year before
the veteran or service member’s last entry into active service.How to applyThe VA
requires you to submit evidence in support of your claim, demonstrating that
your child was killed in the line of duty or that his or her death resulted
from a service-connected condition. This evidence may include service records,
medical records and other documentation.For more information: Federal VA: Parents' Dependency and Indemnity Compensation​​​Veterans who have available home loan guaranty entitlement may
also obtain a guaranteed loan, or possibly a direct loan, from the VA to
supplement the grants to acquire a specially adapted home.For more information: Federal VA: Home Loans The federal
VA offers additional compensation, called Special Monthly Compensation, to
veterans with very severe service-connected disabilities, or who have lost (or
lost the use of) limbs, organs or extremities as a result of their military
service. The VA may
also pay higher rates of compensation if you have lost or lost the use of more
than one limb, organ or extremity, or if it is combined with another
service-connected disability or condition, such as blindness or deafness.Special
Monthly Compensation may also be paid to veterans, spouses, surviving spouses
and parents if they are bedridden, housebound or require the aid and attendance
of another person to perform the basic functions of everyday life, such as
eating, dressing, bathing and going to the bathroom.Special Monthly Compensation is set based on federal law and is not subject to state or federal income tax.  More information about how Special Monthly Compensation is calculated can be found on the federal VA's website.EligibilityVeterans
must meet all of the federal VA’s requirements for Disability Compensation to be eligible for Special Monthly Compensation,
including having been released from military service under honorable
conditions, meaning an honorable or general discharge.Spouses,
surviving spouses and parents must meet the requirements for dependency and
indemnity compensation to be eligible. See
Dependency and Indemnity Compensation
(DIC) and Parents’ Dependency and
Indemnity Compensation.For more information: Federal VA: Special
Monthly Compensation Fact SheetMilitary service members can receive expedited processing of disability claims from Social Security. Benefits available through Social Security are different than those from the Department of Veterans Affairs and require a separate application.The expedited process is used for military service members who become disabled while on active military service on or after October 1, 2001, regardless of where the disability occurs.​For more information:​ ​SSA: Disability Benefits for Wounded WarriorsTo start a claim, find a veteran service officer near you.Sign up for updates from ODVA on Disability Compensation below:
