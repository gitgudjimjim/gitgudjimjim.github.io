Residence (TR) program is a work-based Psychosocial Residential Rehabilitation
Treatment Program offering a therapeutic residential setting for veterans
involved in Compensated Work Therapy (CWT). The TR program provides a rehabilitation-focused residential
setting for veterans recovering from chronic mental illness, chemical
dependency and homelessness.TR provides a bridge
between hospitalization or intensive outpatient treatment and successful
community reintegration. It utilizes a residential therapeutic community of
peer and professional support, with a strong emphasis on increasing personal responsibility
and achievement of individualized rehabilitation goals.This program differs from
other VA-operated residential bed programs in that participants contribute
(using their CWT earnings) to the cost of operating and maintaining their
residences and are responsible for planning, purchasing and preparing their own
meals.Find out more: Federal VA Compensated Work TherapyTo start a claim, find a veteran service officer near you.Sign up for updates from ODVA on Emergency Assistance below:
