You are here:Whether you're seeking a correction of your military record, a review of your discharge, or obtaining copies of your DD-214 or your medals, read below to find out how to get started.Requests to have military records corrected are handled
through each branch of service’s Board of Correction of Military Records. All requests to correct an error to military records must be
filed within three years of discovery of the error and contain evidence, such
as signed statements from you and other witnesses or copies of records that
support your case.For more information: National Archives and Records Administration: Military Service Records​Leaving the military with a less-than-honorable
discharge can dramatically impact your post-service life, including
disqualifying you for certain veterans benefits and negatively affecting your
job prospects. While the process is not simple and the results not guaranteed,
there is a way to appeal, and possibly upgrade, the classification of your
discharge.Each branch of the military maintains a separate discharge
review board with authority to change, correct or modify military discharges.
You can access their websites individually below.

obtaining services records, a DD-214, or replacement awards and medals must

branches of service. The fastest way to obtain a copy is through their eVetRecs.For more information: National Personnel Records Center​To start a claim, find a veteran service officer near you.
