error or to remove an injustice. DD Form 214 does not list gender, but it does
list your name. While for most non-transgender people a service record showing a former name does
not communicate any sensitive information, for transgender people disclosure of the former name can
be equivalent to disclosure of transgender status. This can be considered an injustice, and will be the
strongest basis for your request to update your name on the DD 214.Generally speaking, to update your DD 214 military discharge record, you will need two things: a completed DD Form 149 (Application for Correction of Military Record) and evidence to support your name change request. If possible, this evidence should include proof of your legal name change and gender transition, such as a U.S. passport, driver's license or government-issued ID card showing your updated name and gender.The Oregon Department of Veterans' Affairs and its LGBTQ veteran coordinator office can assist you with this process. A copy of DD Form 149 can be found online here​.For more information: "Transgender People and Military Records" ​The Veterans Health Administration is the largest integrated health care system in the United States and strives to be a national leader in providing care to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender veterans.

services provided to American Indian and Alaskan Native eligible veterans. For more information: Federal VA: Tribal Health Care BenefitsThe Task Force on Incarcerated Veterans was established through House Bill 2838 (Chapter 824, Oregon
Laws 2015), which passed during the 2015 Oregon Legislative Session. The mission of the Task Force was
to research, study, and make recommendations to the Legislature regarding outreach, information, and
assistance to incarcerated veterans with respect to their earned federal and state veterans’ benefits, as
well as other available services and resources.  Read the Report​​This program offers outreach to veterans
incarcerated in state and federal prisons, and referrals and short-term case
management assistance upon release from prison.HCRV services include:

Re-entry Veterans Services​VA benefits are affected if a beneficiary is
convicted of a felony and imprisoned for more than 60 days. Disability
compensation paid to an incarcerated veteran rated 20 percent or more disabled
is limited to the 10 percent rate. Payments are not reduced for participants in
work-release programs, residing in halfway houses or under community control.Failure to notify the VA of a veteran’s
incarceration can result in overpayment of benefits and the subsequent loss of
all VA financial benefits until the overpayment is recovered. VA benefits will
not be provided to any veteran or dependent wanted for an outstanding felony
warrant.The VA may be able to take a portion of the
amount that an incarcerated veteran is not receiving and pay it to his or her
dependents, if they can show need. When a veteran is released from prison, his
or her compensation or pension benefits may be restored. Depending upon the
type of disability, the VA may schedule a medical examination to see if the
veteran’s disability has improved or worsened.For more information: contact
your local veteran service officer, or visit the Federal VA: Incarcerated Veterans webpage.​There is a growing effort nationally and in
Oregon to institute veterans’ courts or dockets to allow district attorneys to
send military members and veterans into treatment, rather than jail, when they
commit a non-violent offense. These courts are staffed by people who take into
consideration the charges and challenges facing veterans who return home from
war. They may allow some military members to enter into mental health diversion
programs as treatment for non-violent infractions as opposed to automatically
jailing the off ender.The law relies on the judgment of a
prosecutor, who will determine on a case-by-case basis which defendants may be
eligible for diversion. These prosecutors must consider, for example, whether a
veteran who spent four years at a military base should be offered the same
diversion opportunity as one who deployed twice to combat situations in
Afghanistan or Iraq. Prosecutors must decide how serious the crime must be
before diversion is taken off the table and must consider the victim of the
offense.For more information: contact
your local District Attorney’s office​ or your local veteran service office.​VJO offers outreach and case management to
veterans involved in law enforcement encounters, overseen by treatment courts,
and incarcerated in local jails. The purpose of the VJO initiative is to avoid
the unnecessary criminalization of mental illness and extended incarceration
among veterans by ensuring that eligible justice-involved veterans have timely
access to VHA mental health and substance abuse services when clinically
indicated, and other VA services and benefits as appropriate.VA Medical Centers have been strongly
encouraged to develop working relationships with the court system and local law
enforcement and must now provide outreach to justice-involved veterans in the
communities they serve.Each VA medical center has been asked to
designate a facility-based Veterans’ Justice Outreach Specialist, responsible
for direct outreach, assessment, and case management for justice-involved
Veterans in local courts and jails, and liaison with local justice system
partners.For more information: Visit the Federal VA:
