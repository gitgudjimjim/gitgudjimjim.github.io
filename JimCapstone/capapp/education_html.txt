You are here:Many veterans turn to higher education to further their skills and training after serving their country.Funding suspended for the 2017-19 Biennium (through June 30, 2019)ODVA apologizes for any inconvenience.The state of Oregon now offers eligible members of the Oregon National Guard the chance to get an education without having to worry about paying for school tuition, provided they attend an Oregon community college or public university and are working toward an associate or bachelor’s degree. ​For more information: www.oregonarmyguard.com/sta​​The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides financial support for
education and housing to honorably discharged veterans with at least 90 days of
aggregate service on or after September 11, 2001, or individuals discharged
with a service-connected disability after 30 days. This benefit provides up to 36
months of education benefits; generally benefits are payable for 15 years

program is another great resource for removing financial barriers to higher
education.Each year, this program awards a select number of
scholarships to veterans across the country to cover not only direct
study-related expenses such as tuition and fees, but also other needs,
including housing and child care. Both veterans and their spouses are eligible
to apply.For more information:

valuable resource for reducing the cost of education and training programs.
This benefit can be used to pay for up to 36 months of costs for many different
programs including:
Generally,
these benefits must be accessed within 10 years of your separation from active
duty. Unlike the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the Montgomery GI Bill is not transferable
to veterans’ family members.You may be eligible for this benefit if you have an honorable
discharge and you have a high school diploma or GED, and if the nature of your
service meets all of the requirements of one of four VA qualification categories.For more
information: Federal VA: Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) Benefits​Top-up allows the federal VA to reimburse you for all or a
portion of the charges for your college courses that are not covered under
certain military education programs. The amount of this benefit can be equal to
the difference between the total cost of a college course and the amount of
Tuition Assistance (TA) that is paid by the military for the course.Who qualifies?To be eligible for the Top-up benefit, you must be approved
for federal TA by a military department and be eligible for either Montgomery
GI Bill (MGIB) – Active Duty benefits or the Post-9/11 GI Bill.For more information: Federal VA: Tuition Assistance Top Up​​This federal program provides additional funds toward your
education expenses at a number of participating colleges and universities nationwide.
It is meant to fill the payment gap in situations where the maximum amount
awarded by your Post 9/11 GI Bill falls short of the total cost of attendance
at your school.Institutions voluntarily enter into a Yellow Ribbon
Agreement with VA and choose the amount of tuition and fees that will be
contributed. VA matches that amount and issues payments directly to the
institution, with no additional charge to your GI Bill entitlement. Contact
your institution to see if they participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program.Who qualifies?To access this benefit, you must:

For more information: Federal VA: Yellow Ribbon Program​​REAP provides educational assistance to members of the
Reserve components called to active duty in response to a war or national
emergency declared by the president or Congress.Who qualifies?Eligible veterans must be a member of a Ready Reserve
component (Selected Reserve, Individual Ready Reserve, or Inactive National
Guard) to pay into the “buy-up” program. National Guard members are eligible if they
were serving under Title 32 orders for 90 consecutive days as authorized by the
president or secretary of defense for a national emergency and that was
supported by federal funds.Noteworthy:The Post-9/11 GI Bill in many ways has replaced REAP because
it also provides educational assistance benefits for Reserve and National Guard
members called to active duty on or after September 11, 2001, and in many cases
provides a greater benefit than REAP.For more information: Federal VA: Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP)​​This federal VA program provides education and job training
to aid your transition back into the civilian workforce. It applies to veterans
in general, but also has specific provisions for disabled veterans and their
family members.Find out more: Federal VA: Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Services​You can receive college credit for certain types of
education and training you received in the military, saving you money and time
as you pursue your education goals. All universities and local community colleges throughout
Oregon accept guidance from the American Council on Education (ACE), which
provides recommendations on how to award academic credit for military training.
To claim college credit for military training, request a
transcript from your military service branch and submit it to your local higher
learning institution. Request a transcript: Veterans of the Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps,
and Navy can access their Joint Services Transcript (JST) online by visiting
the JST website.  Air Force veterans should
contact the Community College of the Air Force (CCAF)​ to receive transcripts.​Attending college in Oregon is now more affordable for some recently-relocated veterans thanks to an Oregon law eliminating out-of-state education costs. Oregon House Bill 2158, signed into
law in the summer of 2013, states that if you are a veteran of the armed forces
pursuing undergraduate studies at a public institution in Oregon, you will pay
tuition rates and fees no greater than the Oregon resident rate — even if you are
not yet considered a permanent resident of the state.These savings also apply to veterans’ dependents using
transferred benefits, as well as orphans of veterans who died on active duty.Note: Certain online-only programs may be excluded from this
program.This benefit does not apply to graduate students or active
duty military members or their dependents.For Graduate StudentsSimilar to the above program, HB 4021, signed into law in
the spring of 2014, reduces out-of-state tuition costs for nonresident veterans
attending graduate school in Oregon.Under this program, qualified student-veterans will have their nonresident tuition
reduced after all other VA benefits and Gift Aid (grants and fee remissions)
have been deducted. Loans received through financial aid do not fall into this
category.For more information:
contact the veterans’ service office or financial aid office at your local
institution.​Voyager is a tuition benefit that is available to Oregon
veterans who served as members of the National Guard or Reserves in an active
duty capacity in a combat zone on or after September 11, 2001.Under this program, eligible student veterans will be
awarded a fee remission for no more than the difference between campus tuition
and mandatory fees and expected military tuition benefits. This program is
meant to work in conjunction with other educational aid programs; thus, you are
still responsible for obtaining federal military tuition benefits. If you are not
eligible for federal tuition benefits, you must demonstrate proof of
ineligibility. What it covers:Voyager is a "last dollar award," meaning it works
to ensure that you do not pay tuition costs if your other federal military
education benefits fall short. The typical maximum length of the award is four
years for undergraduate programs (a fifth year may be approved under certain
programs). This benefit is only available to those seeking their initial
bachelor’s degree, and it carries a maximum credit limit of 15 course credits
beyond the minimum needed for degree completion.The Voyager Tuition Assistance Program does not cover
E-Campus or Distance courses. This benefit is not transferable to a veteran’s
spouse or dependents.For more information:  Contact your campus financial services office.​Are you a veteran seeking training in the construction,
industrial or manufacturing trades? If so, you may be able to use your
veterans’ educational benefits for apprenticeship programs such as Oregon
Apprenticeship Opportunities Statewide.This program, offered through the Oregon Bureau of Labor and
Industries (BOLI) in partnership with Oregon businesses and local
apprenticeship committees, offers career opportunities through paid on-the-job
training and education, with a focus on building and industrial career fields.If an existing apprenticeship program does not have an
approved veteran’s program in place, you can coordinate the establishment of a
new training program by communicating with an employer and the Apprenticeship
and Training Division.For more information: Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI)​: Apprenticeship and Training DivisionThis program offers education and training opportunities to eligible dependents of veterans
who are permanently and totally disabled due to a service-related condition or
of veterans who died while on active duty or as a result of a service-related
condition.Benefits may be used for degree and certificate programs,
apprenticeship, and on-the-job training. If you are a spouse, you may take a
correspondence course. Remedial, deficiency, and refresher courses may be
approved under certain circumstances.Find more information: Federal VA: Survivors' and Dependents' Education Assistance Program (DEA)​VEAP is available if you elected to make contributions from
your military pay to participate in this education benefit program. The
government matches your contributions on a 2-for-1 basis.Educational programs for which these benefits may be used
include college degree and certificate programs, technical or vocational
training, flight training, apprenticeships, and licensing and certification
tests, as well as various others.Benefit entitlement is for one to 36 months, depending on
the number of monthly contributions. You have 10 years from your release from
active duty to use VEAP benefits. If the entitlement is not used after the
10-year period, your portion remaining in the fund will be automatically
refunded.If you are currently on active duty and wish to receive VEAP
benefits, you must have at least three months of contributions available.For more information: Federal VA: Veterans Educational Assistance Program (VEAP)​GI Bill® is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
