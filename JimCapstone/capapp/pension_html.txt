The financially struggling spouses and children of deceased wartime veterans may also be eligible for pension benefits.It is highly recommended that you seek the free assistance of an ODVA-trained and certified veteran service officer, who can help you determine the benefits you may qualify for and walk you through the application process.​This benefit
provides supplemental income to help veterans and their families cope with
challenges arising from homelessness and other financial crises. The amount
paid is set by federal law and varies based on your net worth and the amount
you and your dependents receive from other sources.For more information: Federal VA: Veterans
Pension​If you are
the financially struggling spouse or child of a deceased veteran who served his
or her country during wartime, you may be eligible for survivors pension, a benefit of the federal VA.Also known
as death pension, survivors pension
is a tax-free, needs-based monetary benefit for the survivors of deceased
veterans, if your income is low enough to meet the requirements set by
Congress. You must also be single (children must be unmarried to be eligible;
spouses must not have remarried).For more information: Federal VA:
Survivors PensionVeterans and
survivors who qualify for a federal VA pension due to financial circumstances
may be eligible for additional compensation if you require the aid and
attendance of another person. This tax-free supplement to the monthly pension is
commonly called A&A. You or your
deceased spouse must meet the federal VA’s service, age, disability and income
requirements for Veterans Pension or Survivors
Pension to be eligible for A&A.Since the A&A
provision increases the income allowance, you may be eligible for a
supplemented pension even if your income is too high for a basic pension.
However, you must still meet the applicable service and age or disability
requirements.For more information: Federal VA: Aid
& Attendance and Housebound​Veterans and
survivors who qualify for a federal VA pension due to financial circumstances
may be eligible for additional compensation if you are housebound, meaning confined to your home because of permanent
disability. You or your
deceased spouse must meet the federal VA’s service, age, disability and income
requirements for veterans pension or survivors pension to be eligible for this
additional tax-free monthly compensation.Since the housebound
provision increases the income allowance, you may be eligible for a
supplemented pension even if your income is too high for a basic pension.
However, you must still meet the applicable service and age or disability
requirements.Those who
qualify for a pension may also be eligible for additional compensation due to needing
the aid and attendance (A&A) of another person, which is based on different
criteria. However, you cannot receive both A&A and Housebound benefits at
the same time.How to applyThe federal
VA requires you to submit evidence in support of your request for an increased
monthly pension, preferably a report from your attending physician validating
the need for housebound care.For more information: Federal VA: Aid
